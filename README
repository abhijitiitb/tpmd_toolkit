------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TPMD toolkit is an analysis code designed to study kinetics pathways that are rare
at the timescale accessible with classical Molecular Dynamics (MD). The toolkit is 
programmed to run efficiently on parallel computers. It was developed at Computer Aided
Rational Design of Materials lab, Chemical Engineering at Indian Institute of 
Technology Bombay, India. 

The primary authors of the code are Abhijit Chatterjee (abhijit@che.iitb.ac.in) and 
Saurabh Shivpuje (saurabh.shivpuje@gmail.com).

The files and directories included in this directory are: 

src_tools/		TPMD pre- and post-analysis tools' source code
trajectories/		trajectories to be analyzed should be arranged here
start.sh		execution file to operate all analysis tools
parameters.txt		input file required for TPMD analysis
README			this file

After doing any analysis, the following directories might be generated:

results/		all the results of the analysis are stored here
trajs/			temporary files created for processing data
			
-------------

First, make sure the trajectories you want to analyze are correctly arranged in
the "trajectories" directory. To learn about this, refer to "examples" directory
in the parent directory to this directory. 

Next, provide all the inputs in parameters.txt file. Again you can refer to
parameters.txt files provided in the sub-directories of "examples".

Now you should make the start.sh file executable using command "chmod +x start.sh". 

After ensuring all the above steps, you can run the program with command
"./start.sh". The rest of the instructions and information will appear in the 
terminal as you follow the steps mentioned by the program.

Also, changing names of any directory or subdirectories and files from this directory
onwards can cause errors in the running program.

Note: The information of x, y, and z coordinates of atoms should be mentioned in 3rd, 
4th and 5th column of trajectory file respectively. Atoms should be present in 
increasing order of their index number.
