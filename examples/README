TPMD toolkit test examples

There are three distinct examples in this directory to give the user a
thorough understanding of this toolkit. The first step in TPMD is 
to create multiple trajectories. In these examples, LAMMPS(Large-scale 
Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) is needed to create such 
trajectories. The LAMMPS WWW Site at lammps.sandia.gov has more information
about the code and its uses. 

The three example directories included here are:

Ag_trimer_example	Studying the kinetic pathways of three silver atoms
			adsorbed on the surface of the silver metal slab
LiVac_example		Studying the activation energy barrier for lithium 
			vacancy hop in LiFePO4 (LFP) solid
SiVac_example		Studying the silicon vacancy hop in Si bulk

Each of these example directories contains the input files that you can learn
about README files in each directory.
