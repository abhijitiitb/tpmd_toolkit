#Number of significant digits involved in calculation is depended on input we provide here. It is recommended to use distance parameter with atleast 4 significant digit after decimal point. Name of trajectory file should remain same. To analyze in series fashion, give input 1 in 'Number of row in parallel analysis'. Do not delete any line in this file till line number 20. Do not write units next to any values.
