Computes rate constant, pre-exponential factor and activation barrier for 
user-selected kinetic pathways in statestat.txt using the procedure described
in S Shivpuje, M Kumawat, A Chatterjee, Computer Physics Communications 
262, 107828 (2021)
statestat.txt contains details of transitions obtained in MD/TPMD trajectories.
For each trajectory the states accessed from a given state (state 0)
and the first passage time are provided. This information is used to calculate
the rate constant, pre-exponential factor and activation barrier.
